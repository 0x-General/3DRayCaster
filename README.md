-Introduction

This application is a 3d ray caster, which aims to model the rendering technique 
of the popular first-person shooter video game "Wolfenstein". You can move around 
a 3D scene designed by your own.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Usage

Once the application is running, you can move around using the arrow keys, as well 
as "a" and "s" for rotating. That is: UP-Key makes you move forward, DOWN-Key backwards 
, LEFT-Key to the left, and RIGHT-Key to the right. Always with respect to the direction 
in which the player is headed.

It is not possible to go trough walls, that is , there are collisions between the player and 
the walls surrounding him/her.
